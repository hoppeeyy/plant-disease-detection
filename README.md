I have developed a machine learning model designed to detect plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves.
This innovative solution leverages computer vision to identify visual symptoms of diseases, such as spots, discolorations, or patterns on the leaf surface.
By preprocessing the images and feeding them into a trained model—likely using techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—the system accurately classifies the type of disease affecting the plant.
This technology provides a cost-effective and efficient tool for farmers and agricultural professionals to diagnose plant health issues promptly, enabling early intervention and better crop management.
