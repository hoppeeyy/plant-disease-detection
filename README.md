 Plant Disease Detection Using CNN
This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect plant diseases with high accuracy by analyzing images of leaves. By simply uploading a photo of a plant leaf, the model can identify whether the plant is healthy or infected, and if infected, it classifies the specific disease.

🔍 Project Highlights:
🚀 94% Accuracy on a large and diverse dataset of plant leaf images.

🧠 Built using a deep CNN architecture optimized for image classification tasks.

🌱 Supports detection of multiple common plant diseases across various crops.

📸 Input: Just a clear image of the plant leaf.

⚙️ Trained on a large-scale dataset covering thousands of labeled images.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch (whichever you used)

OpenCV (for image preprocessing)

NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas (for analysis and visualization)

📊 Model Workflow:
Image Preprocessing – Resize, normalize, and augment input leaf images.

CNN Architecture – Designed with convolutional layers, ReLU activations, max pooling, and dropout for regularization.

Training – Performed on a large dataset of labeled plant leaf images.

Evaluation – Achieved 94% accuracy on validation/testing set.

💡 Use Cases:
Smart agriculture and crop monitoring

Early disease detection to reduce crop loss

Integration with drones or mobile apps for on-field diagnosis
